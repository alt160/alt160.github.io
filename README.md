# Welcome to ALT160

## Where the space is unbreakable, but the code might be.

Hello! You’ve stumbled upon ALT160’s GitHub repository, where dry humor and quirky, silly, and stupid coding projects come to life.

### What’s in here?
- Fun and experimental code projects that range from the silly to harmless pranks to the suprisingly useful.
- Occasional deep dives into coding with a side of sarcasm.
- A showcase of the infamous “unbreakable space” (ALT+160).

Feel free to explore, laugh (hopefully), or contribute if you like.

### How to run the projects:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Follow any specific project instructions in their respective folders (or improvise, I won’t judge).
3. It probably only works on my box.

### Want more?
Check out **[ALT160.com](https://alt160.com)** (or whenever I actually set it up).

Thanks for visiting, and remember: code responsibly.
