            <p>The term <strong>"2 bits"</strong> has an interesting history beyond its technical use. Historically, "bit" comes from the word <strong>"binary digit,"</strong> but in the context of currency, <strong>"2 bits"</strong> was a colloquial term used to describe a quarter of a dollar, or 25 cents. This usage dates back to the Spanish colonial period in the Americas when Spanish coins, known as <strong>"pieces of eight,"</strong> were commonly used. One of these coins was worth 8 reales, and thus a <strong>"bit"</strong> referred to one-eighth of a dollar. Consequently, <strong>"2 bits"</strong> equaled one-quarter of a dollar.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, in digital computing, <strong>"2 bits"</strong> is also exactly 1/4 of a byte, since a byte consists of 8 bits. This parallel between historical monetary terminology and modern digital data is a fascinating overlap, showing how a term can bridge the gap between past and present in surprising ways.</p>
